 Project Title
US Heart Patients Classification - Machine Learning

Overview
This project focuses on classifying heart patients in the US using machine learning techniques. The aim is to analyze patient data, extract meaningful insights, and predict the likelihood of heart-related issues based on various health parameters. This project applies machine learning algorithms to classify patients and evaluate the model's performance.

Introduction
Heart diseases are one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early diagnosis and classification of heart-related risks can save lives. This project leverages machine learning techniques to classify heart patients into risk categories based on a dataset of health indicators collected in the US.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes features such as:

Age
Gender
Cholesterol Levels
Blood Pressure
Smoking Habits
Physical Activity
Diabetes Status
Other relevant health indicators.

Project Objective
The main objectives of this project are:

To explore and preprocess heart patient data.
To build a classification model to predict patient risk categories.
To evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Methodology
Data Collection: Load the dataset.
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, normalize/standardize features, and encode categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize patterns and correlations.
Feature Engineering: Select important features for the model.
Model Building: Train machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, or Neural Networks.
Model Evaluation: Assess performance using confusion matrix, ROC-AUC, and other relevant metrics.
Deployment (optional): Deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit for real-world use.
Results
